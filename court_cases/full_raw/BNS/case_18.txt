HEADNOTE:
     The  victim  girl (PW. 13) aged about 8 years  was	 the
daughter  of  the  neighbour of the respondent.	 She  was  a
friend	of respondent's niece and both the children used  to
play  together.	 According to the prosecution case,  on	 the
fateful	 day  when respondent's niece and PW.  13  with	 her
younger	 brother were playing in respondent's drawing  hall,
and there was no one else in the house, the respondent	sent
his niece with younger brother of PW. 13 outside. He  bolted
the door from inside, completely stripped off himself,	made
PW.  13	 completely  naked and asked  her  to  do  fellatio.
Thereafter he slightly inserted his penis into her vulva and
lay  over her. After sometime he freed the child. While	 she
was leaving the drawing hall, the respondent threatened	 her
not  to	 disclose  his	affairs	 to  anyone.  She,  however,
narrated the incident to respondent's niece.
     In the evening PW. 13 told her mother (PW. 6) that	 the
respondent  had asked her to suck his private part. She did
not  narrate  the whole incident out of fear. The  next	 day
when  PW.  13  and respondent's niece were  talking  of	 the
incident,  their friend PW. 12 came there. PW.	13  narrated
the  incident  to her and other girl friends. On  the  third
day,  PW.  13  told the entire incident to  her	 mother	 who
conveyed it to her neighbours PWs. 9 and 10 on telephone. At
about  9 p.m. when the appellant (PW.5), the father  of	 the
victim girl, returned home and learnt about the	 occurrence,
he  accompanied	 by  PWs. 7,9 and 10  went  to	respondent's
house,	but he was not there and they informed	the  brother
and sister-in-law of the respondent of the purpose of  their
visit.	They  all  waited  there  till	midnight  when	 the
respondent  came. The respondent, assessing  the  situation,
voluntarily  confessed his crime. He admitted that he  raped
PW.  13	 and  also  committed  the  same  crime	 on  earlier
occasions with his niece and other minor girls, but being  a
doctor	he  had	 been careful enough not  to  rupture  their
hymen.	The  brother of the respondent begged of PW.  5	 and
others	not to do anything till the arrival of his  parents.
Next  morning  when respondent's parents reached,  he  again
admitted his abominable crime of sexual assault on PW. 13.
     It	 took  2-3  days  more to PW. 5	 to  get  a  written
complaint  (Ext. P.7) lodged with the police through PW.  8.
The  police  investigation culminated in the  trial  of	 the
respondent for an offence of rape committed on PW. 13.
     The  trial court held that the prosecution against	 the
respondent  was launched due to some enmity between the	 two
families and that the
						       923
prosecution  did  not  adduce any  acceptable  evidence	 for
holding	 the respondent guilty of offence under s. 376	IPC.
It accordingly acquitted the respondent.
     The  State	 filed an appeal an  against  the  acquittal
before the High Court. The complainant-appellant also  filed
a criminal revision challenging the legality of the order of
acquittal.  On	the  basis of an  artical  relating  to	 the
incident  published  in a foreign magazine, a  petition	 was
addressed  to the Chief Justice of India with a copy to	 the
Chief Justice  of the High Court concerned and on its  basis
another criminal revision petition was registered. The	High
Court disposed of all the three cases by a common  judgment.
It accepted the oral testimony of prosecution witnesses	 and
the  extra-judicial confession made by the  respondent.	 It,
however,  held the respondent guilty of an offence under  s.
354  IPC and sentenced him to pay a fine of Rs. 3,000  only.
The complainant-appellant filed the appeal by special  leave
to this Court.	The State did not file any appeal.
     It	 was contended on behalf of the appellant  that	 the
High Court erred in holding the respondent guilty of a minor
offence under s. 354 IPC when all the necessary	 ingredients
to  constitute	an offence punishable under s. 376  IPC	 had
been  satisfactorily established; and the sentence  of	fine
alone  imposed was grossly inadequate and  not	commensurate
with the gravity of the offence committed by the respondent.
     Allowing  the appeal and setting aside the judgment  of
the High Court, this Court,
     HELD   :	1.  The	  prosecution	has   satisfactorily
established  its case that the respondent committed rape  on
PW. 13 by proving all the necessary ingredients required  to
make  out  an offence of rape punishable under	Section	 376
IPC. [p. 947 B]
     2. When the evidence of PW. 13-that the respondent	 put
his  male  organ  inside her vagina  and  clutched  her	 and
thereafter  she suffered pain-is taken with the evidence  of
medical officer who found an abrasion on the medical side of
labia  majora and redness present around the  labia   minora
with  white  discharge even after 5 days, it can  be  safely
concluded  that	 there was partial  penetration	 within	 the
labia  majora  or the vulva or pudenda which  in  the  legal
sense is sufficient to constitute the offence of
						       924
rape.  Moreover,  the  respondent  himself  confessed  twice
admitting the commission of rape without rupturing the hymen
which  confession is not disbelieved by the High Court.	 [p.
946 C; E-F]
     3.1.  The evidence of PW. 13 is amply corroborated	 not
only by the medical evidence and the evidence of PW. 12	 but
also  by the  plenary confession of the respondent  himself.
[p. 947 A]
     3.2  Even	in  cases  wherein there  is  lack  of	oral
corroboration to that of a prosecutrix, a conviction can  be
safely	recorded, provided the evidence of the	victim	does
not suffer from any basic infirmity, and the  `probabilities
factor' does not render it unworthy of credence, and that as
a  general  rule,  corroboration cannot	 be  insisted  upon,
except	from the medical evidence, where, having  regard  to
the  circumstances  of	the case, medical  evidence  can  be
expected to be forthcoming. [pp. 939 GH; p. 940 A]

referred to.
     4.1  In  order to constitute an offence  of  `Rape'  as
envisaged  by  the first Explanation to s.  375	 IPC,  while
there  must  be	 penetration in	 the  technical	 sence,	 the
slightest penetration would be sufficient and a complete act
of sexual intercourse is not at all necessary. [p. 945 D-H]

     4.2  In  the  instant  case  there	 is  acceptable	 and
reliable evidence that
						       925
there	was  slight  penetration  though  not	a   complete
penetration. [p. 946 B]
     4.3.  The medical officer was of the opinion  that	 the
abrasion measuring one and a half inches in length found  on
the  medial side of the labia majora and the redness  around
the  labia  minora  could have been caused on  the  date  of
incident.  [pp. 942 H; 943 A]
     Merely  because the inexperienced medical	officer	 has
opined	that it was an attempt to commit rape,	probably  on
the  ground that there was no sign of complete	penetration,
her legal opinion as to the nature of the offence  committed
by the respondent cannot be accepted. (p. 943 CD]
     4.4. A medical witness called in as an expert to assist
the  Court is not a witness of fact and the  evidence  given
by  the medical officer is really of an	 advisory  character
given  on  the basis of the symptoms found  on	examination.
The  expert witness is expected to put before the Court	 all
materials inclusive of the data which induced him to come to
the  conclusion	 and enlighten the Court  on  the  technical
aspect	of  the case by explaining the terms of	 science  so
that  the  Court although, not an expert may  form  its	 own
judgment  on those materials after giving due regard to	 the
expert's  opinion  because  once  the  expert's	 opinion  is
accepted,  it is not the opinion of the medical officer	 but
of the Court. [p. 943 D-F]

Edition) by Modi, referred to.
     5. Law does not require that the evidence of an  extra-
judicial  confession  should in all cases  be  corroborated.
However,   the	confession  of	the  respondent	  is   amply
corroborated  by the evidence of the victim (PW.  13)  whose
testimony in turn is  corroborated by PWs. 5, 6, 7, 9 and 10
and also by the medical evidence. [p. 939 B-C]
     Piara  Singh  v.  State of Punjab, [1978]	1  SCR	597,
referred to.
     6. In view of s. 378 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,
1973 (corresponding to s. 417 of the old Code), in cases  of
appeals	 against acquittal as a matter of jurisdiction,	 the
whole case is at large for review by the High Court both  as
to the facts and the law and it is clothed with the plenary
						       926
powers to go through the entire evidence and to come to	 its
own  conclusions  of  guilt or	otherwise  of  the  indicted
persons	 as  the  established facts  warrant  and  to  award
appropriate  sentence  which will be commensurate  with	 the
gravity of the offence in case of conviction.

     7.1.  The	findings  of the  High	Court,	rendered  in
exercise of its appellate jurisdiction are findings of	fact
which  cannot  be  reopened in appeal  especially  when	 the
respondent has not challenged those findings and when  there
is  absolutely	no  reason muchless  compelling	 reason	 for
holding that those findings are either in utter disregard of
the evidence or unreasonable and perverse or any part of the
evidence in favour of the respondent is jettisoned. [p.	 936
FG]
     7.2.  Although the High Court was fully satisfied	with
the  evidence  of  the victim PW. 13  and  found  sufficient
corroboration on all material particulars from the  evidence
of  PWs.  5,  6, 9, 10 and 12  and  held  the  extrajudicial
confession  given  by  the  respondent	as  true  and	made
voluntarily and not obtained by any inducement, coercion  or
threat and that there could be penetration without  rupture,
yet,  having  accepted the entire  prosecution	evidence  in
toto,  it  committed an error in entertaining a	 doubt	with
regard	to the accusation of rape holding that there was  no
sign of injuries and that the offence was not one punishable
under  s. 376 IPC or under s. 376 read with s. 511  IPC	 but
only one under s. 354 IPC.
					       [p. 936 A-C]
     7.3.  The	High Court even after  observing  that	"the
respondent's  activities were menace to the neighbours"	 has
shown  a misplaced sympathy to the respondent which has	 led
to the miscarriage of justice.	The finding that the offence
is one of outraging the modesty of woman for which  sentence
of   imprisonment  is  not  compulsory	is   erroneous	 and
untenable.
						[p. 942 A-C]
						       927
     8. Having regard to the seriousness and gravity of	 the
repugnant  crime  of rape perpetrated on PW. 13	 who  was  8
years  old  on the date of the commission  of  the  offence,
while convicting the respondent under Section 376 IPC he  is
sentenced to undergo  rigorous imprisonment for a period  of
seven  years and to pay a fine of Rs. 25,000 to	 the  victim
girl.
					       [p. 948 B-C]
     9.	 Though all sexual assaults on female  children	 are
not  reported  and  do not come to light  yet  there  is  an
alarming and shocking increase of sexual offences  committed
on  children.  This is due to the reasons that children	 are
ignorant  of the act of the rape and are not able  to  offer
resistence and become easy prey for lusty brutes who display
the  unscrupulous,  deceitful and insidious  art  of  luring
female children and young girls.  Therefore, such  offenders
who   are  menace  to  the  civilised  society	 should	  be
mercilessly  and inexorably punished in the severest  terms.
