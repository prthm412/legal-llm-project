    "text": "3. General explanations.—(1) Throughout this Sanhita every definition of an offence, every penal \nprovision, and every Illustration of every such definition or penal provision, shall be understood subject \nto the exceptions contained in the Chapter entitled “General Exceptions”, though those exceptions are not \nrepeated in such definition, penal provision, or Illustration. \nIllustrations. \n(a) The sections in this Sanhita, which contain definitions of offences, do not express that a child \nunder seven years of age cannot commit such offences; but the definitions are to be understood subject to \nthe general exception which provides that nothing shall be an offence which is done by a child under \nseven years of age. \n(b) A, a police officer, without warrant, apprehends Z, who has committed murder. Here A is not \nguilty of the offence of wrongful confinement; for he was bound by law to apprehend Z, and therefore the \ncase falls within the general exception which provides that “nothing is an offence which is done by a \nperson who is bound by law to do it”. \n(2) Every expression which is explained in any Part of this Sanhita, is used in every Part of this \nSanhita in conformity with the explanation. \n(3) When property is in the possession of a person’s spouse, clerk or servant, on account of that \nperson, it is in that person’s possession within the meaning of this Sanhita.\n\n \nExplanation.—A person employed temporarily or on a particular occasion in the capacity of a clerk \nor servant, is a clerk or servant within the meaning of this sub-section. \n(4) In every Part of this Sanhita, except where a contrary intention appears from the context, words \nwhich refer to acts done extend also to illegal omissions. \n(5) When a criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all, \neach of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if it were done by him alone. \n(6) Whenever an act, which is criminal only by reason of its being done with a criminal knowledge or \nintention, is done by several persons, each of such persons who joins in the act with such knowledge or \nintention is liable for the act in the same manner as if the act were done by him alone with that knowledge \nor intention. \n(7) Wherever the causing of a certain effect, or an attempt to cause that effect, by an act or by an \nomission, is an offence, it is to be understood that the causing of that effect partly by an act and partly by \nan omission is the same offence. \nIllustration. \nA intentionally causes Z’s death, partly by illegally omitting to give Z food, and partly by beating Z. \nA has committed murder. \n(8) When an offence is committed by means of several acts, whoever intentionally cooperates in the \ncommission of that offence by doing any one of those acts, either singly or jointly with any other person, \ncommits that offence.  \nIllustrations. \n(a) A and B agree to murder Z by severally and at different times giving him small doses of poison. \nA and B administer the poison according to the agreement with intent to murder Z. Z dies from the \neffects the several doses of poison so administered to him. Here A and B intentionally cooperate in the \ncommission of murder and as each of them does an act by which the death is caused, they are both guilty \nof the offence though their acts are separate. \n(b) A and B are joint jailors, and as such have the charge of Z, a prisoner, alternatively for six hours \nat a time. A and B, intending to cause Z’s death, knowingly cooperate in causing that effect by illegally \nomitting, each during the time of his attendance, to furnish Z with food supplied to them for that purpose. \nZ dies of hunger. Both A and B are guilty of the murder of Z. \n(c) A, a jailor, has the charge of Z, a prisoner. A, intending to cause Z’s death, illegally omits to \nsupply Z with food; in consequence of which Z is much reduced in strength, but the starvation is not \nsufficient to cause his death. A is dismissed from his office, and B succeeds him. B, without collusion or \ncooperation with A, illegally omits to supply Z with food, knowing that he is likely thereby to cause Z’s \ndeath. Z dies of hunger. B is guilty of murder, but, as A did not cooperate with B. A is guilty only of an \nattempt to commit murder. \n(9) Where several persons are engaged or concerned in the commission of a criminal act, they may be \nguilty of different offences by means of that act. \nIllustration. \nA attacks Z under such circumstances of grave provocation that his killing of Z would be only \nculpable homicide not amounting to murder. B, having ill-will towards Z and intending to kill him, and \nnot having been subject to the provocation, assists A in killing Z. Here, though A and B are both engaged \nin causing Z’s death, B is guilty of murder, and A is guilty only of culpable homicide. \nCHAPTER II \nOF PUNISHMENTS"

But A is guilty of abetting theft, and is liable to the \nsame punishment as if B had committed theft. \nExplanation 4.—The abetment of an offence being an offence, the abetment of such an abetment is \nalso an offence. \nIllustration. \nA instigates B to instigate C to murder Z. B accordingly instigates C to murder Z, and C commits that \noffence in consequence of B’s instigation. B is liable to be punished for his offence with the punishment \nfor murder; and, as A instigated B to commit the offence, A is also liable to the same punishment. \nExplanation 5.—It is not necessary to the commission of the offence of abetment by conspiracy that \nthe abettor should concert the offence with the person who commits it. It is sufficient if he engages in the \nconspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is committed.\n\n \nIllustration. \nA concerts with B a plan for poisoning Z. It is agreed that A shall administer the poison. B then \nexplains the plan to C mentioning that a third person is to administer the poison, but without mentioning \nA’s name. C agrees to procure the poison, and procures and delivers it to B for the purpose of its being \nused in the manner explained. A administers the poison; Z dies in consequence. Here, though A and C \nhave not conspired together, yet C has been engaged in the conspiracy in pursuance of which Z has been \nmurdered. C has therefore committed the offence defined in this section and is liable to the punishment \nfor murder."

A, on this provocation, fires a pistol at Y, neither \nintending nor knowing himself to be likely to kill Z, who is near him, but out of sight. A kills Z. Here \nA has not committed murder, but merely culpable homicide. \n(c) A is lawfully arrested by Z, a bailiff. A is excited to sudden and violent passion by the arrest, \nand kills Z. This is murder, in as much as the provocation was given by a thing done by a public \nservant in the exercise of his powers. \n(d) A appears as a witness before Z, a Magistrate. Z says that he does not believe a word of A’s \ndeposition, and that A has perjured himself. A is moved to sudden passion by these words, and kills Z. \nThis is murder. \n(e) A attempts to pull Z’s nose. Z, in the exercise of the right of private defence, lays hold of A to \nprevent him from doing so. A is moved to sudden and violent passion in consequence, and kills Z. \nThis is murder, in as much as the provocation was giving by a thing done in the exercise of the right of \nprivate defence. \n(f) Z strikes B. B is by this provocation excited to violent rage. A, a bystander, intending to take \nadvantage of B’s rage, and to cause him to kill Z, puts a knife into B’s hand for that purpose. B kills Z \nwith the knife. Here B may have committed only culpable homicide, but A is guilty of murder. \nException 2.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender in the exercise in good faith of the \nright of private defence of person or property, exceeds the power given to him by law and causes the \ndeath of the person against whom he is exercising such right of defence without premeditation, and \nwithout any intention of doing more harm than is necessary for the purpose of such defence. \nIllustration. \nZ attempts to horsewhip A, not in such a manner as to cause grievous hurt to A. A draws out a pistol. \nZ persists in the assault. A believing in good faith that he can by no other means prevent himself from \nbeing horsewhipped, shoots Z dead. A has not committed murder, but only culpable homicide. \nException 3.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, being a public servant or aiding a \npublic servant acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the powers given to him by law, and \ncauses death by doing an act which he, in good faith, believes to be lawful and necessary for the due \ndischarge of his duty as such public servant and without ill-will towards the person whose death is \ncaused. \nException 4.—Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden \nfight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offender’s having taken undue \nadvantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner. \nExplanation.—It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or commits the first \nassault. \nException 5.—Culpable homicide is not murder when the person whose death is caused, being above \nthe age of eighteen years, suffers death or takes the risk of death with his own consent. \nIllustration. \nA, by instigation, voluntarily causes Z, a child to commit suicide. Here, on account of Z’s youth, he \nwas incapable of giving consent to his own death; A has therefore abetted murder."

A unfastens the moorings, and thus intentionally causes \nthe boat to drift down the stream. Here A intentionally causes motion to Z, and he does this by disposing \nsubstances in such a manner that the motion is produced without any other action on any person’s part. A \nhas therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done so without Z’s consent, in order to the \ncommitting of any offence, or intending or knowing it to be likely that this use of force will cause injury, \nfear or annoyance to Z, A has used criminal force to Z. \n(b) Z is riding in a chariot.

A has therefore used \nforce to Z; and as A has acted thus intentionally, without Z’s consent, in order to the commission of an \noffence. A has used criminal force to Z. \n(d) A intentionally pushes against Z in the street. Here A has by his own bodily power moved his \nown person so as to bring it into contact with Z. He has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he \nhas done so without Z’s consent, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten \nor annoy Z, he has used criminal force to Z. \n(e) A throws a stone, intending or knowing it to be likely that the stone will be thus brought into \ncontact with Z, or with Z’s clothes, or with something carried by Z, or that it will strike water and dash up \nthe water against Z’s clothes or something carried by Z.

Here A intentionally uses force to her, and if he does so \nwithout her consent intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy her, \nhe has used criminal force to her.\n\n \n(g) Z is bathing. A pours into the bath water which he knows to be boiling. Here A intentionally by \nhis own bodily power causes such motion in the boiling water as brings that water into contact with Z, or \nwith other water so situated that such contact must affect Z’s sense of feeling; A has therefore \nintentionally used force to Z; and if he has done this without Z’s consent intending or knowing it to be \nlikely that he may thereby cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, A has used criminal force. \n(h) A incites a dog to spring upon Z, without Z’s consent.

    "text": "303. Theft.—(1) Whoever, intending to take dishonestly any movable property out of the possession \nof any person without that person’s consent, moves that property in order to such taking, is said to \ncommit theft. \nExplanation 1.—A thing so long as it is attached to the earth, not being movable property, is not the \nsubject of theft; but it becomes capable of being the subject of theft as soon as it is severed from the \nearth. \nExplanation 2.—A moving effected by the same act which affects the severance may be a theft. \nExplanation 3.—A person is said to cause a thing to move by removing an obstacle which prevented \nit from moving or by separating it from any other thing, as well as by actually moving it. \nExplanation 4.—A person, who by any means causes an animal to move, is said to move that animal, \nand to move everything which, in consequence of the motion so caused, is moved by that animal. \nExplanation 5.—The consent mentioned in this section may be express or implied, and may be given \neither by the person in possession, or by any person having for that purpose authority either express or \nimplied. \nIllustrations. \n(a) A cuts down a tree on Z’s ground, with the intention of dishonestly taking the tree out of Z’s \npossession without Z’s consent. Here, as soon as A has severed the tree in order to such taking, he has \ncommitted theft. \n(b) A puts a bait for dogs in his pocket, and thus induces Z’s dog to follow it. Here, if A’s intention \nbe dishonestly to take the dog out of Z’s possession without Z’s consent. A has committed theft as soon \nas Z’s dog has begun to follow A. \n(c) A meets a bullock carrying a box of treasure. He drives the bullock in a certain direction, in order \nthat he may dishonestly take the treasure. As soon as the bullock begins to move, A has committed theft \nof the treasure. \n(d) A being Z’s servant, and entrusted by Z with the care of Z’s plate, dishonestly runs away with the \nplate, without Z’s consent. A has committed theft. \n(e) Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A, the keeper of a warehouse, till Z shall return. A \ncarries the plate to a goldsmith and sells it. Here the plate was not in Z’s possession. It could not therefore \nbe taken out of Z’s possession, and A has not committed theft, though he may have committed criminal \nbreach of trust. \n(f) A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z occupies. Here the ring is in Z’s \npossession, and if A dishonestly removes it, A commits theft. \n(g) A finds a ring lying on the highroad, not in the possession of any person. A, by taking it, commits \nno theft, though he may commit criminal misappropriation of property. \n(h) A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z’s house. Not venturing to misappropriate the \nring immediately for fear of search and detection, A hides the ring in a place where it is highly \nimprobable that it will ever be found by Z, with the intention of taking the ring from the hiding place and \nselling it when the loss is forgotten. Here A, at the time of first moving the ring, commits theft. \n(i) A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweler, to be regulated. Z carries it to his shop. A, not owing to the \njeweler any debt for which the jeweler might lawfully detain the watch as a security, enters the shop \nopenly, takes his watch by force out of Z’s hand, and carries it away. Here A, though he may have \ncommitted criminal trespass and assault, has not committed theft, in as much as what he did was not done \ndishonestly.\n\n \n(j) If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the watch lawfully as a security for \nthe debt, and A takes the watch out of Z’s possession, with the intention of depriving Z of the property as \na security for his debt, he commits theft, in as much as he takes it dishonestly. \n(k) Again, if A, having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of Z’s possession without Z’s consent, not \nhaving paid what he borrowed on the watch, he commits theft, though the watch is his own property in as \nmuch as he takes it dishonestly. \n(l) A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z’s possession without Z’s consent, with the intention of \nkeeping it until he obtains money from Z as a reward for its restoration. Here A takes dishonestly; A has \ntherefore committed theft. \n(m) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z’s library in Z’s absence, and takes away a book \nwithout Z’s express consent for the purpose merely of reading it, and with the intention of returning it. \nHere, it is probable that A may have conceived that he had Z’s implied consent to use Z’s book. If this \nwas A’s impression, A has not committed theft. \n(n) A asks charity from Z’s wife. She gives A money, food and clothes, which A knows to belong to \nZ her husband. Here it is probable that A may conceive that Z’s wife is authorised to give away alms. If \nthis was A’s impression, A has not committed theft. \n(o) A is the paramour of Z’s wife. She gives a valuable property, which A knows to belong to her \nhusband Z, and to be such property as she has no authority from Z to give. If A takes the property \ndishonestly, he commits theft. \n(p) A, in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be A’s own property, takes that property out \nof Z’s possession. Here, as A does not take dishonestly, he does not commit theft. \n(2) Whoever commits theft shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term \nwhich may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both and in case of second or subsequent \nconviction of any person under this section, he shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term \nwhich shall not be less than one year but which may extend to five years and with fine: \nProvided that in cases of theft where the value of the stolen property is less than five thousand rupees, \nand a person is convicted for the first time, shall upon return of the value of property or restoration of the \nstolen property, shall be punished with community service."

Dishonest misappropriation of property.—Whoever dishonestly misappropriates or converts \nto his own use any movable property, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a \nterm which shall not be less than six months but which may extend to two years and with fine. \nIllustrations. \n(a) A takes property belonging to Z out of Z’s possession, in good faith believing at the time when he \ntakes it, that the property belongs to himself. A is not guilty of theft; but if A, after discovering his \nmistake, dishonestly appropriates the property to his own use, he is guilty of an offence under this \nsection. \n(b) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z’s library in Z’s absence, and takes away a book \nwithout Z’s express consent. Here, if A was under the impression that he had Z’s implied consent to take \nthe book for the purpose of reading it, A has not committed theft. But, if A afterwards sells the book for \nhis own benefit, he is guilty of an offence under this section. \n(c) A and B, being, joint owners of a horse. A takes the horse out of B’s possession, intending to use \nit. Here, as A has a right to use the horse, he does not dishonestly misappropriate it. But, if A sells the \nhorse and appropriates the whole proceeds to his own use, he is guilty of an offence under this section. \nExplanation 1.—A dishonest misappropriation for a time only is a misappropriation within the \nmeaning of this section.\n\n \nIllustration. \nA finds a Government promissory note belonging to Z, bearing a blank endorsement. A, knowing that \nthe note belongs to Z, pledges it with a banker as a security for a loan, intending at a future time to restore \nit to Z.

From the direction and contents of the letter \nhe learns to whom the note belongs. He appropriates the note. He is guilty of an offence under this \nsection. \n(c) A finds a cheque payable to bearer. He can form no conjecture as to the person who has lost the \ncheque. But the name of the person, who has drawn the cheque, appears. A knows that this person can \ndirect him to the person in whose favour the cheque was drawn. A appropriates the cheque without \nattempting to discover the owner. He is guilty of an offence under this section. \n(d) A sees Z drop his purse with money in it. A picks up the purse with the intention of restoring it           \nto Z, but afterwards appropriates it to his own use.

Making a false document.—A person is said to make a false document or false electronic \nrecord— \n(A) Who dishonestly or fraudulently— \n(i) makes, signs, seals or executes a document or part of a document; \n(ii) makes or transmits any electronic record or part of any electronic record; \n(iii) affixes any electronic signature on any electronic record; \n(iv) makes any mark denoting the execution of a document or the authenticity of the \nelectronic signature, \nwith the intention of causing it to be believed that such document or part of document, electronic \nrecord or electronic signature was made, signed, sealed, executed, transmitted or affixed by or by the \nauthority of a person by whom or by whose authority he knows that it was not made, signed, sealed, \nexecuted or affixed; or \n(B) Who without lawful authority, dishonestly or fraudulently, by cancellation or otherwise, \nalters a document or an electronic record in any material part thereof, after it has been made, executed \nor affixed with electronic signature either by himself or by any other person, whether such person be \nliving or dead at the time of such alteration; or \n(C) Who dishonestly or fraudulently causes any person to sign, seal, execute or alter a document \nor an electronic record or to affix his electronic signature on any electronic record knowing that such \nperson by reason of unsoundness of mind or intoxication cannot, or that by reason of deception\n\n \npractised upon him, he does not know the contents of the document or electronic record or the nature \nof the alteration. \nIllustrations. \n(a) A has a letter of credit upon B for rupees 10,000, written by Z. A, in order to defraud B, adds \ncipher to the 10,000, and makes the sum 1,00,000 intending that it may be believed by B that Z so wrote \nthe letter. A has committed forgery. \n(b) A, without Z’s authority, affixes Z’s seal to a document purporting to be a conveyance of an \nestate from Z to A, with the intention of selling the estate to B and thereby of obtaining from B the \npurchase-money. A has committed forgery. \n(c) A picks up a cheque on a banker signed by B, payable to bearer, but without any sum having been \ninserted in the cheque. A fraudulently fills up the cheque by inserting the sum of ten thousand rupees. A \ncommits forgery. \n(d) A leaves with B, his agent, a cheque on a banker, signed by A, without inserting the sum payable \nand authorises B to fill up the cheque by inserting a sum not exceeding ten thousand rupees for the \npurpose of making certain payments. B fraudulently fills up the cheque by inserting the sum of                 \ntwenty thousand rupees. B commits forgery. \n(e) A draws a bill of exchange on himself in the name of B without B’s authority, intending to \ndiscount it as a genuine bill with a banker and intending to take up the bill on its maturity. Here, as A \ndraws the bill with intent to deceive the banker by leading him to suppose that he had the security of B, \nand thereby to discount the bill, A is guilty of forgery. \n(f) Z’s will contains these words—“I direct that all my remaining property be equally divided \nbetween A, B and C.” A dishonestly scratches out B’s name, intending that it may be believed that the \nwhole was left to himself and C. A has committed forgery. \n(g) A endorses a Government promissory note and makes it payable to Z or his order by writing on \nthe bill the words “Pay to Z or his order” and signing the endorsement. B dishonestly erases the words \n“Pay to Z or his order”, and thereby converts the special endorsement into a blank endorsement. B \ncommits forgery. \n(h) A sells and conveys an estate to Z. A afterwards, in order to defraud Z of his estate, executes a \nconveyance of the same estate to B, dated six months earlier than the date of the conveyance to Z, \nintending it to be believed that he had conveyed the estate to B before he conveyed it to Z. A has \ncommitted forgery. \n(i) Z dictates his will to A. A intentionally writes down a different legatee from the legatee named            \nby Z, and by representing to Z that he has prepared the will according to his instructions, induces Z to \nsign the will. A has committed forgery. \n(j) A writes a letter and signs it with B’s name without B’s authority, certifying that A is a man of \ngood character and in distressed circumstances from unforeseen misfortune, intending by means of such \nletter to obtain alms from Z and other persons. Here, as A made a false document in order to induce Z to \npart with property, A has committed forgery. \n(k) A without B’s authority writes a letter and signs it in B’s name certifying to A’s character, \nintending thereby to obtain employment under Z. A has committed forgery in as much as he intended to \ndeceive Z by the forged certificate, and thereby to induce Z to enter into an express or implied contract \nfor service. \nExplanation 1.—A man’s signature of his own name may amount to forgery. \nIllustrations. \n(a) A signs his own name to a bill of exchange, intending that it may be believed that the bill was \ndrawn by another person of the same name. A has committed forgery.\n\n \n(b) A writes the word “accepted” on a piece of paper and signs it with Z’s name, in order that B may \nafterwards write on the paper a bill of exchange drawn by B upon Z, and negotiate the bill as though it \nhad been accepted by Z. A is guilty of forgery; and if B, knowing the fact, draws the bill upon the paper \npursuant to A’s intention, B is also guilty of forgery. \n(c) A picks up a bill of exchange payable to the order of a different person of the same name. A \nendorses the bill in his own name, intending to cause it to be believed that it was endorsed by the person \nto whose order it was payable; here A has committed forgery. \n(d) A purchases an estate sold under execution of a decree against B. B, after the seizure of the estate, \nin collusion with Z, executes a lease of the estate, to Z at a nominal rent and for a long period and dates \nthe lease six months prior to the seizure, with intent to defraud A, and to cause it to be believed that the \nlease was granted before the seizure. B, though he executes the lease in his own name, commits forgery \nby antedating it. \n(e) A, a trader, in anticipation of insolvency, lodges effects with B for A’s benefit, and with intent to \ndefraud his creditors; and in order to give a colour to the transaction, writes a promissory note binding \nhimself to pay to B a sum for value received, and antedates the note, intending that it may be believed to \nhave been made before A was on the point of insolvency. A has committed forgery under the first head of \nthe definition. \nExplanation 2.—The making of a false document in the name of a fictitious person, intending it to be \nbelieved that the document was made by a real person, or in the name of a deceased person, intending it \nto be believed that the document was made by the person in his lifetime, may amount to forgery. \nIllustration. \nA draws a bill of exchange upon a fictitious person, and fraudulently accepts the bill in the name of \nsuch fictitious person with intent to negotiate it. A commits forgery. \nExplanation 3.—For the purposes of this section, the expression “affixing electronic signature” shall \nhave the meaning assigned to it in clause (d) of sub-section (1) of section 2 of the Information \nTechnology Act, 2000 (21 of 2000)."

It is proved that he was in \npossession of a particular stolen article. The fact that, at the same time, he was in possession of many \nother stolen articles is relevant, as tending to show that he knew each and all of the articles of which he \nwas in possession to be stolen. \n(b) A is accused of fraudulently delivering to another person a counterfeit currency which, at the time \nwhen he delivered it, he knew to be counterfeit. The fact that, at the time of its delivery, A was possessed \nof a number of other pieces of counterfeit currency is relevant.

The fact that the dog \nhad previously bitten X, Y and Z, and that they had made complaints to B, are relevant. \n(d) The question is, whether A, the acceptor of a bill of exchange, knew that the name of the payee \nwas fictitious. The fact that A had accepted other bills drawn in the same manner before they could have \nbeen transmitted to him by the payee if the payee had been a real person, is relevant, as showing that A \nknew that the payee was a fictitious person. \n(e) A is accused of defaming B by publishing an imputation intended to harm the reputation of B. \nThe fact of previous publications by A respecting B, showing ill-will on the part of A towards B is \nrelevant, as proving A's intention to harm B's reputation by the particular publication in question. The \nfacts that there was no previous quarrel between A and B, and that A repeated the matter complained of \nas he heard it, are relevant, as showing that A did not intend to harm the reputation of B. \n(f) A is sued by B for fraudulently representing to B that C was solvent, whereby B, being induced to \ntrust C, who was insolvent, suffered loss. The fact that, at the time when A represented C to be solvent, C \nwas supposed to be solvent by his neighbours and by persons dealing with him, is relevant, as showing \nthat A made the representation in good faith. \n(g) A is sued by B for the price of work done by B, upon a house of which A is owner, by the order \nof C, a contractor. A's defence is that B's contract was with C.

The fact that B's attention was drawn on other occasions to the defect of that particular car is \nrelevant. The fact that B was habitually negligent about the cars which he let to hire is irrelevant. \n(o) A is tried for the murder of B by intentionally shooting him dead. The fact that A on other \noccasions shot at B is relevant as showing his intention to shoot B. The fact that A was in the habit of \nshooting at people with intent to murder them is irrelevant. \n(p) A is tried for a crime.

A letter from A's deceased agent to \nA, saying that he had received the rent on A's account and held it at A's orders is a relevant fact. \n(f) The question is, whether A and B were legally married. The statement of a deceased clergyman \nthat he married them under such circumstances that the celebration would be a crime is relevant. \n(g) The question is, whether A, a person who cannot be found, wrote a letter on a certain day. The \nfact that a letter written by him is dated on that day is relevant. \n(h) The question is, what was the cause of the wreck of a ship. A protest made by the captain, whose \nattendance cannot be procured, is a relevant fact. \n(i) The question is, whether a given road is a public way. A statement by A, a deceased headman of \nthe village, that the road was public, is a relevant fact. \n(j) The question is, what was the price of grain on a certain day in a particular market.

Court may presume existence of certain facts.—(1) The Court may presume the existence of \nany fact which it thinks likely to have happened, regard being had to the common course of natural \nevents, human conduct and public and private business, in their relation to the facts of the particular case. \nIllustrations. \nThe Court may presume that— \n(a) a man who is in possession of stolen goods soon, after the theft is either the thief or has \nreceived the goods knowing them to be stolen, unless he can account for his possession; \n(b) an accomplice is unworthy of credit, unless he is corroborated in material particulars; \n(c) a bill of exchange, accepted or endorsed, was accepted or endorsed for good consideration; \n(d) a thing or state of things which has been shown to be in existence within a period shorter than \nthat within which such things or state of things usually cease to exist, is still in existence; \n(e) judicial and official acts have been regularly performed; \n(f) the common course of business has been followed in particular cases; \n(g) evidence which could be and is not produced would, if produced, be unfavourable to the \nperson who withholds it; \n(h) if a man refuses to answer a question which he is not compelled to answer by law, the answer, \nif given, would be unfavourable to him; \n(i) when a document creating an obligation is in the hands of the obligor, the obligation has been \ndischarged. \n(2) The Court shall also have regard to such facts as the following, in considering whether such \nmaxims do or do not apply to the particular case before it:— \n(i) as to Illustration (a)—a shop-keeper has in his bill a marked rupee soon after it was stolen, \nand cannot account for its possession specifically, but is continually receiving rupees in the course of \nhis business; \n(ii) as to Illustration (b) —A, a person of the highest character, is tried for causing a man's death \nby an act of negligence in arranging certain machinery. B, a person of equally good character, who \nalso took part in the arrangement, describes precisely what was done, and admits and explains the \ncommon carelessness of A and himself; \n(iii) as to Illustration (b) —a crime is committed by several persons. A, B and C, three of the \ncriminals, are captured on the spot and kept apart from each other. Each gives an account of the crime \nimplicating D, and the accounts corroborate each other in such a manner as to render previous \nconcert highly improbable; \n \n(iv) as to Illustration (c)—A, the drawer of a bill of exchange, was a man of business. B, the \nacceptor, was a young and ignorant person, completely under A's influence; \n(v) as to Illustration (d)—it is proved that a river ran in a certain course five years ago, but it is \nknown that there have been floods since that time which might change its course; \n(vi) as to Illustration (e)—a judicial act, the regularity of which is in question, was performed \nunder exceptional circumstances; \n(vii) as to Illustration (f)—the question is, whether a letter was received. It is shown to have been \nposted, but the usual course of the post was interrupted by disturbances; \n(viii) as to Illustration (g)—a man refuses to produce a document which would bear on a contract \nof small importance on which he is sued, but which might also injure the feelings and reputation of \nhis family; \n(ix) as to Illustration (h)—a man refuses to answer a question which he is not compelled by law \nto answer, but the answer to it might cause loss to him in matters unconnected with the matter in \nrelation to which it is asked; \n(x) as to Illustration (i)—a bond is in possession of the obligor, but the circumstances of the case \nare such that he may have stolen it."

Exclusion of evidence to contradict answers to questions testing veracity.—When a \nwitness has been asked and has answered any question which is relevant to the inquiry only in so far as it \ntends to shake his credit by injuring his character, no evidence shall be given to contradict him; but, if he \nanswers falsely, he may afterwards be charged with giving false evidence. \nException 1.—If a witness is asked whether he has been previously convicted of any crime and \ndenies it, evidence may be given of his previous conviction. \nException 2.—If a witness is asked any question tending to impeach his impartiality, and answers it \nby denying the facts suggested, he may be contradicted. \nIllustrations. \n(a) A claim against an underwriter is resisted on the ground of fraud. The claimant is asked whether, \nin a former transaction, he had not made a fraudulent claim. He denies it. Evidence is offered to show that \nhe did make such a claim. The evidence is inadmissible. \n(b) A witness is asked whether he was not dismissed from a situation for dishonesty. He denies it. \nEvidence is offered to show that he was dismissed for dishonesty. The evidence is not admissible. \n(c) A affirms that on a certain day he saw B at Goa. A is asked whether he himself was not on that \nday at Varanasi. He denies it. Evidence is offered to show that A was on that day at Varanasi. The \nevidence is admissible, not as contradicting A on a fact which affects his credit, but as contradicting the \nalleged fact that B was seen on the day in question in Goa. In each of these cases, the witness might, if his \ndenial was false, be charged with giving false evidence. \n(d) A is asked whether his family has not had a blood feud with the family of B against whom he \ngives evidence. He denies it. He may be contradicted on the ground that the question tends to impeach his \nimpartiality."
