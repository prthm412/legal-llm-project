It is proved that he was in \npossession of a particular stolen article. The fact that, at the same time, he was in possession of many \nother stolen articles is relevant, as tending to show that he knew each and all of the articles of which he \nwas in possession to be stolen. \n(b) A is accused of fraudulently delivering to another person a counterfeit currency which, at the time \nwhen he delivered it, he knew to be counterfeit.

The fact that the dog \nhad previously bitten X, Y and Z, and that they had made complaints to B, are relevant. \n(d) The question is, whether A, the acceptor of a bill of exchange, knew that the name of the payee \nwas fictitious. The fact that A had accepted other bills drawn in the same manner before they could have \nbeen transmitted to him by the payee if the payee had been a real person, is relevant, as showing that A \nknew that the payee was a fictitious person. \n(e) A is accused of defaming B by publishing an imputation intended to harm the reputation of B. \nThe fact of previous publications by A respecting B, showing ill-will on the part of A towards B is \nrelevant, as proving A's intention to harm B's reputation by the particular publication in question.

A's defence is that B's contract was with C. The fact that A paid C for the work in \nquestion is relevant, as proving that A did, in good faith, make over to C the management of the work in \nquestion, so that C was in a position to contract with B on C's own account, and not as agent for A. \n(h) A is accused of the dishonest misappropriation of property which he had found, and the question \nis whether, when he appropriated it, he believed in good faith that the real owner could not be found. The \nfact that public notice of the loss of the property had been given in the place where A was, is relevant, as \nshowing that A did not in good faith believe that the real owner of the property could not be found. The \nfact that A knew, or had reason to believe, that the notice was given fraudulently by C, who had heard of \nthe loss of the property and wished to set up a false claim to it, is relevant, as showing that the fact that A \nknew of the notice did not disprove A's good faith. \n(i) A is charged with shooting at B with intent to kill him. In order to show A's intent, the fact of A's \nhaving previously shot at B may be proved. \n(j) A is charged with sending threatening letters to B.

The fact that B's attention was drawn on other occasions to the defect of that particular car is \nrelevant. The fact that B was habitually negligent about the cars which he let to hire is irrelevant. \n(o) A is tried for the murder of B by intentionally shooting him dead.

B is a \nmerchant in Bengaluru, who has written letters addressed to A and received letters purporting to be \nwritten by him. C, is B's clerk whose duty it was to examine and file B's correspondence. D is B's broker, \nto whom B habitually submitted the letters purporting to be written by A for the purpose of advising him \nthereon. The opinions of B, C and D on the question whether the letter is in the handwriting of A are \nrelevant, though neither B, C nor D ever saw A write. \n(2) When the Court has to form an opinion as to the electronic signature of any person, the opinion of \nthe Certifying Authority which has issued the Electronic Signature Certificate is a relevant fact."

On whom burden of proof lies.—The burden of proof in a suit or proceeding lies on that \nperson who would fail if no evidence at all were given on either side. \n \n \nIllustrations. \n(a) A sues B for land of which B is in possession, and which, as A asserts, was left to A by the will of \nC, B's father. If no evidence were given on either side, B would be entitled to retain his possession. \nTherefore, the burden of proof is on A. \n(b) A sues B for money due on a bond. The execution of the bond is admitted, but B says that it was \nobtained by fraud, which A denies. If no evidence were given on either side, A would succeed, as the \nbond is not disputed and the fraud is not proved. Therefore, the burden of proof is on B."

A, B and C, three of the \ncriminals, are captured on the spot and kept apart from each other. Each gives an account of the crime \nimplicating D, and the accounts corroborate each other in such a manner as to render previous \nconcert highly improbable; \n \n(iv) as to Illustration (c)—A, the drawer of a bill of exchange, was a man of business.

It is shown to have been \nposted, but the usual course of the post was interrupted by disturbances; \n(viii) as to Illustration (g)—a man refuses to produce a document which would bear on a contract \nof small importance on which he is sued, but which might also injure the feelings and reputation of \nhis family; \n(ix) as to Illustration (h)—a man refuses to answer a question which he is not compelled by law \nto answer, but the answer to it might cause loss to him in matters unconnected with the matter in \nrelation to which it is asked; \n(x) as to Illustration (i)—a bond is in possession of the obligor, but the circumstances of the case \nare such that he may have stolen it."

Judge to decide as to admissibility of evidence.—(1) When either party proposes to give \nevidence of any fact, the Judge may ask the party proposing to give the evidence in what manner the \nalleged fact, if proved, would be relevant; and the Judge shall admit the evidence if he thinks that the fact, \nif proved, would be relevant, and not otherwise. \n(2) If the fact proposed to be proved is one of which evidence is admissible only upon proof of some \nother fact, such last mentioned fact must be proved before evidence is given of the fact first mentioned, \nunless the party undertakes to give proof of such fact, and the Court is satisfied with such undertaking. \n(3) If the relevancy of one alleged fact depends upon another alleged fact being first proved, the \nJudge may, in his discretion, either permit evidence of the first fact to be given before the second fact is \nproved, or require evidence to be given of the second fact before evidence is given of the first fact. \nIllustrations. \n(a) It is proposed to prove a statement about a relevant fact by a person alleged to be dead, which \nstatement is relevant under section 26. The fact that the person is dead must be proved by the person \nproposing to prove the statement, before evidence is given of the statement. \n(b) It is proposed to prove, by a copy, the contents of a document said to be lost.

The Court may, in its discretion, either require the property to be identified before the denial of \nthe possession is proved, or permit the denial of the possession to be proved before the property is \nidentified. \n(d) It is proposed to prove a fact A which is said to have been the cause or effect of a fact in issue. \nThere are several intermediate facts B, C and D which must be shown to exist before the fact A can be \nregarded as the cause or effect of the fact in issue. The Court may either permit A to be proved before B, \nC or D is proved, or may require proof of B, C and D before permitting proof of A."
